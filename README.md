# Shan-Fatah
Name: Shan <br>
Age: 24 <br>
Country: Norway <br>
Hobbies: Working out, baking, laughing <br>
Work: I dont have a job right now, but I really hope I can land an intership till summer!! <br>
Skills: I feel like I blend easily with people, I like to talk and get to know others, and in a country where everyone is divided in their own little groups being social is a skill ig haha. Besides that I am a quick learner, I am a BIG overthinker, but I am equally as good on finding a solution to the problems. <br>

I am a software engineer student, and I have been told that it is a risky study to choose because getting a job is not like what it was 5-10 years ago BUT I really love to code and to create so I choose to go through with it anyways. I have learned many new prograamming languages like C#, JavaScript, ASP.NET, PHP and many more. I would say I am a decent programmer, but I hope I can become even better!!
